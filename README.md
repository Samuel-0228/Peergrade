## 🤖 Role of AI (Important)

AI is used **only** to:
- Summarize aggregated statistics
- Describe observable patterns
- Provide neutral, academic explanations

AI **does not**:
- Access raw individual data
- Predict outcomes
- Advise or recommend programs
- Influence user decisions directly

AI functions as a **research narrator**, not a decision-maker.
